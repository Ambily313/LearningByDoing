    "\n",
    "The datetime module in Python provides classes for manipulating dates and times, including date, time, datetime, and timedelta.\n",

    "The \"epoch\" is a reference point for time used in many computing systems. The Unix epoch starts at 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.\n",
    "Timestamps are measured in seconds since this epoch. For example, a timestamp of 0 represents the Unix epoch itself, and a timestamp of 1609459200 represents 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 2021.\n",
